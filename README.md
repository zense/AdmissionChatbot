The communication of potentialstudents with a university department is performed manually and it is a very time consuming procedure. 
The opportunity to communicate with on a one-to-one basis is highly  valued.  
However  with  many  hundreds  of  applications  each  year,  one-to-one  conversations are  not  feasible  in  most  cases.  
The  communication  will  require  a  member  of  academic  staff  to expend several hours
to find suitable answers and contact each student. It would be useful to reduce his costs and time.
